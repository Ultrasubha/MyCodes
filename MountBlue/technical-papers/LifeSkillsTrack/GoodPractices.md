# Good Practices for Software Development

## Q.1) Which point(s) were new to you?
- Make notes while discussing requirements with your team
- Some companies use tools like Trello, Jira for documentation. But if your team is not using any such tool, you should write down the requirements and share it with the team. This will help you get immediate feedback. Also, this will serve as a reference for future conversations
- Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page
- You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup


## Q.2) Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
- Maintaining attention for longer periods of time.
- Be a good Listener.
- Try out various productivity apps.

Other than that since I believe my communication part is ok as of now. I don't have much to progress in this domain.
